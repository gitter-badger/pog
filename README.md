# Pog.js

Pog is a modern MVC style framework built on top of [io](http://iojs.org) and [koa](http://koajs.com). It's built to be fast, simple and easy to configure, with sane defaults and flexible boilerplates to get you up and running as quickly as possible.

It's a work in progress. Check back soon.
